Little script to upload statics to a S3 bucket by using official Amazon SDK.

## AWS Credentials

In order to use this module, you'll need to have AWS Credentials. You can load them, two ways:

* By passing directly to the method as second parameter.
* By having a ENV variable with the path to a file with the credentials.
  The ENV variable is `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PATH` and it should have `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`, `region` and `bucket`.

## Install

```bash
npm install s3-folder-upload -D
```

In case you want to use the CLI, you can install it globally:

```bash
npx s3-folder-upload
```

## Require
```javascript
const s3FolderUpload = require('s3-folder-upload')
// ES6: import s3FolderUpload from 's3-folder-upload'

const directoryName = 'statics'
// I strongly recommend to save your credentials on a JSON or ENV variables, or command line args
const credentials = {
  "accessKeyId": "<Your Access Key Id>",
  "secretAccessKey": "<Your Secret Access Key>",
  "region": "<Your Aimed Region>",
  "bucket": "<Your Bucket Name>"
}

// optional options to be passed as parameter to the method
const options = {
  useFoldersForFileTypes: false,
  useIAMRoleCredentials: false
}

// optional cloudfront invalidation rule
const invalidation = {
  awsDistributionId: "<Your CloudFront Distribution Id>",
  awsInvalidationPath: "<The Path to Invalidate>"
}

s3FolderUpload(directoryName, credentials, options, invalidation)
```

## Options
`useFoldersForFileTypes` (default: `true`) - Upload files to a specific subdirectory according to its file type.

`useIAMRoleCredentials` (default: `false`) - It will ignore all the credentials passed via parameters or environment variables in order to use the instance IAM credentials profile.

`uploadFolder` (default: `undefined`) - If it's specified, the statics will be uploaded to the folder, so if you upload `static.js` to `https://statics.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com` with a `uploadFolder` with value `my-statics` the file will be uploaded to: `https://statics.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-statics/static.js`.

`ACL` (default: `public-read`) - It defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access.

`Cache-Control` (default: `public, max-age=31536000`) - HTTP header holds directives (instructions) for caching in both requests and responses.

`Expires` (default: `31536000`) - Header contains the date/time after which the response is considered stale. If there is a Cache-Control header with the max-age or s-maxage directive in the response, the Expires header is ignored.

If you use programatically the library, you could overwrite the `ACL`, `Cache-Control` and `Expires` values to file level.

```javascript
const options = {
  useFoldersForFileTypes: false,
  useIAMRoleCredentials: false,
  filesOptions: {
    'index.html': {
      'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=300'
    }
  }
}

s3FolderUpload(directoryName, credentials, options)
```

## CLI
```bash
s3-folder-upload <folder>

Example:
s3-folder-upload statics
```

**For the AWS Credentials**

* you can define a ENV variable called `AWS_CREDENTIALS_PATH` with the path of the file with the needed info.
* you can pass the needed info via command line parameters:
    ```bash
    s3-folder-upload <folder> --accessKeyId=<your access key id> --bucket=<destination bucket> --region=<region> --secretAccessKey=<your secret access key>
    ```
* you can use `useIAMRoleCredentials` option in order to rely on IAM Profile instance instead any passed by variables and environment

**For Options**

* you can pass the needed info via command line parameters:
    ```bash
    s3-folder-upload <folder> <credentials parameters> --useFoldersForFileTypes=false
    ```

**For CloudFront invalidation**

* you can pass the needed info via command line parameters, the invalidation needs both parameters:
    ```bash
    s3-folder-upload <folder> <credentials parameters> --awsDistributionId=<distributionId> --awsInvalidationPath="/js/*"

### Environment Variables
`S3_FOLDER_UPLOAD_LOG`: You could specify the level of logging for the library.
* `none`: No logging output
* `only_errors`: Only errors are logged
* `all` (default): Errors, progress and useful messages are logged.

Example of use:
```
S3_FOLDER_UPLOAD_LOG=only_errors s3-folder-upload <folder>
```

If you use the library programatically, this ENVIRONEMNT_VARIABLE will be read as well. For example:

```
S3_FOLDER_UPLOAD_LOG=only_errors node upload-script.js
```

## Wish list

- [x] Upload a entire folder to S3 instead file
- [x] Async upload of files to improve time
- [x] Detect automatically the content type of (limited support)
- [x] Return the list of files uploaded with the final URL
- [x] Better support for parameters with the CLI
- [ ] Improve content type function in order to get more and better types of files
- [ ] Avoid to re-upload files if they didn't change
- [ ] Check if cache is blocking updates of statics on website.
- [ ] Map uploaded paths to create a default invalidation paths rule in CloudFront.
