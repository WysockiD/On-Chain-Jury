In my opinion the way we conduct trials today is outdated and with so much on the line, should be held to the highest of technological standards. I believe linking the jury process to the blockchain can have real positive impact as every decision would be immutable and verifiable by all. This will naturally reduce the frequency of mis-trials and increase public confidence in the legal system. So I built my first full stack application On-Chain-Jury to demonstrate the concept. ‚öñÔ∏è

The main point I want to stress here is not the building of the application, I built that for my own self teaching more than anything, but really how useful blockchain technology will be going forward with countless use cases: from tracking biometric data and issuing identifications to fair unrigged elections to digital finance to finally how we stand trail, on-chain.. bringing our world beyond the age of trust and into a new world of technological fact.

üì° Version 1.0.0 üì°

Built by using scafold-eth to help integrate the react.JS front end and Web3 to connect the solidity smart contracts to the back end. A few months of work and I have a new respect for how much work goes into building full stack apps. I have
many more ways I can expand on the app like write an algorithm for the actual jury selection process or have a trigger event occur once the verdict is logged on the chain giving it real world consequences, but for now, I‚Äôm exited to move on to my next project. üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
