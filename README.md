My first Full Stack decentralized application built by using scafold-eth to integrate the react.js front end and web3 to connect the solidity smart contracts to the back end. Ive seen a lot of decentalized voting contracts but yet to see someone put a jury application on-chain. Having trials linked to the blockchain can have real impact as every decision would be immutable and verifiable by all. This will naturally reduce the frequency of mis-trials and increase public confidence in the legal system.
